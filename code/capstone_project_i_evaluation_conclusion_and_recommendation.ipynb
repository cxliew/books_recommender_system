    "For non-personalized recommendation, the popularity-based recommender systems is able to recommend the top 10 popular books, which coincides with the exploratory data analysis result. The content-based recommender system is able to recommend based on similarity in genre. As non-personalized recommendation does not provide predicted ratings, we will be evaluating the collaborative filtering and model-based recommender systems for the choice of our recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For personalized recommendation, there are 7 models in total that are employed and tested and all of the models has a smaller root mean square error (RMSE) as compared to the null model, which is based on random rating prediction. For user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, they have very low coverage (the percentage of the test set that can be predicted from the train set) and the prediction model fair slightly better than the null model with an improvement of 34% improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the coverage and RMSE, we perform a K-means clustering to clusters the books into their similar genre prior to perform a collaborative filtering of user-based and item-based. This has led to an increase of coverage to 55-58% and an improvement of RMSE of 43% compared to the null model. This improvement could possibly due to an increase probability of finding similar users with similar books read compared to the initial user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, whereby the fraction may not comprise of similar users that has read the particular book. However, it is to note that the clustering has limit the books and users to their genres, which limits the user's preference according to a particular genre. In addition, the item-based collaborative filtering have a slightly lower RMSE compared to user-based and it could be due to items are fixed, rather than user-based, which can varies with the presence of similar users and the user preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the model based recommender system, we are able to increase the coverage to 100% with an  improvement of RMSE of 47-53% compared to the null model. This improvement is mainly due to algorithems, which utilizes matrix factorization techniques along with stochastic gradient descent. This allows the alogrithm to learn and regularized the parameters, factorize the original matrix into smaller matrixes to speed up processing and save memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The singular value decomposition algorithms performs better than non-negative matrix factorization likely due to the reduction of dimentionality for the non-important features of the dataset, which allows the alogrithm to learn faster and perform a better prediction. As there is minimal difference between singular value decomposition and singular value decomposition ++, which accounts for the implicit ratings(that is the rating that is being made by the user regardless of the ratings count), we will be selecting the singular value decomposition as our final model as it has the lowest RMSE, which means the lowest error of the predicted rating with the true rating. This will allow us to predict the reader's ratings more accurately and recommend books that are more suited to the readers, leading to an enhanced reader's experience and higher subscription rate, which will increase the business profitability."

    "In conclusion, we have gathered and collected our datasets, performed data cleaning and analyzed the data with visualization methods. In our exploratory data analysis, we discovered majority of the books characteristics in the dataset. We also found that the user book interactions illustrates the long tail situation in which a small fraction of the books are highly rated by the users while a large propotion of the books have low number of ratings by the users. Due to the large dataset and computational limitation, we have set a threshold for ratings of a book required and number of books rated by a user prior to obtain a subset fraction for further analysis.\n",

    "With the dataset and analysis, we have built two models for non-personalized recommendation and seven models for personalized recommendation. For non-personalized recommendation systems, the popularity-based recommender systems is able to recommend the top 10 popular books while the content-based recommender system is able to recommend based on similarity in genre. For the personalized recommendation, all models have RMSE lower than the null model. The singular value decomposition was chosen as our final model as it has the lowest RMSE with 100% coverage compared to the other models, which has either higher RMSE and low coverage (below 100%). Using this selected model, we are able to predict the ratings more accurately and recommend books that are more suited to the readers, leading to an enhanced reader's experience and higher subscription rate, that potentially leads to increase in business profitability."
