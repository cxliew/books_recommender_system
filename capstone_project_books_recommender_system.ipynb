    "There is always a need for book recommendation when one would like to start picking a new book to read. With the vast availability of book choices we have currently, readers always faced with the difficulty of choosing a book to read and on average take a huge amount of time, effort and energy to select and choose a book to read. This include social media, online browsing and book referrals, which is time-consuming [[1]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/Portals/0/Docs/AboutUs/2018%20NATIONAL%20READING%20HABITS%20STUDY%20ON%20ADULTS%20-%20REPORT.pdf). With the current lacking of a book recommendation system in libraries, as a data scientist in the national library, we aim to help reader to save time to decide for which books to read, by developing book recommendations system which matches their  preferences. The team will explore the use of popularity-based system, content-based system and collaborative filtering-based system for predicting the relevant books recommended to the readers. As we are seeking to develop a book recommendation that suit to the readers preference, the model's success will be evaluated based on the precision and recall that will evaluate the correct relevant predictions of book that the reader will prefer to enhance the reader experience.
